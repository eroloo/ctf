## QuizBot (30 points)

[link](http://timesink.be/quizbot/) presents a quiz consists of 1000 simple questions with right answers (I've tried to answer them by hand lmao)

first thought was that it needs to be automated... After that I have observed that after posting wrong answer bot always returns a good one
**Wrong Answer! The answer is:
beach boys**

plan is simple 

**1. send 1000 post requests and download all good answers to file**
**2. send 1000 post requests with correct answers to quizbot and belive that last will return flag**

It worked, flag was **knowl3dg3**
